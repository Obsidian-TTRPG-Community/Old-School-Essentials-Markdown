# Wizard Lock

*2nd Level Magic-User Spell*

**Duration:** Permanent

**Range:** 10â€™

A *wizard lock* spell magically locks a door, gate, similar portal, or any item that has a lock. The magical lock is permanent but may be bypassed as follows:

- **The caster:** Can freely pass through any portals locked by their own spell.
- **A \*knock\* spell:** Allows passage.
- **Higher level casters:** Magic-using characters 3 or more levels higher than the caster of *wizard lock* may pass.
- **Temporary:** Bypassing does not destroy a *wizard lock*.
