# Phantasmal Force

*2nd Level Magic-User Spell*

**Duration:** Concentration

**Range:** 240’

A visual illusion of the caster’s choosing manifests in a 20’ cube area. Three types of illusions may be created:

1. **An illusionary monster:** That can be directed to attack. The monster has an Armor Class of 9 [10] and will vanish if hit in combat.
2. **An illusionary attack:** For example, an avalanche, a falling ceiling, a magic missile, etc. Targets who **save versus spells** are unaffected.
3. **A scene:** Either changing the appearance of the affected area or creating the appearance of something new. The scene disappears if touched.

**Stipulations:** The following apply:

- **Concentration:** Required to maintain the illusion. If the caster moves or loses concentration, the spell ends.
- **Illusionary monsters or attacks:** May appear to be harmful but no real damage is ever inflicted. A character who appears to die actually falls unconscious, a character turned to stone will actually be paralyzed, and so on. Such effects last for 1d4 turns.
- **Illusions from imagination:** If the illusion is of something the caster has not personally seen, the referee should grant targets a bonus to any applicable saving throws.
