# Animate Dead

*5th Level Magic-User Spell*

**Duration:** Permanent

**Range:** 60’


Causes corpses or skeletons to rise as undead skeletons or zombies.

- **Obedient:** Created undead obey the caster’s commands.
- **Special abilities:** They are unable to use any special abilities (including spell casting) that they possessed in life.
- **Duration:** The reanimating magic remains active until dispelled or until the undead are slain.

**Number:** The spell animates up to 1 Hit Die of zombies or skeletons per level of the caster:

- **Skeletons:** Have AC 7 [12] and HD equal to those the creature had in life.
- **Zombies:** Have AC 8 [11] and HD one greater than the creature had in life.
- **Classed characters:** If a PC or NPC with levels in a class is reanimated by this spell, the levels are not counted as HD. For example, the reanimated corpse of a 5th-level fighter would have 2 HD (1 HD as a normal human, +1 for being reanimated as a zombie).
