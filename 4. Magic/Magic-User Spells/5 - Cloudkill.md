# Cloudkill

*5th Level Magic-User Spell*

**Duration:** 6 turns

**Range:** 30’

A poisonous fog streams from the caster’s fingertips, filling a 30’ diameter area.

- **Movement:** The fog moves at 60’ (20’), driven by the wind or, in still conditions, away from the caster.
- **Sinking:** Because the fog is denser than air, it sinks to the lowest point, flowing down hills, into holes, and so forth.
- **Damage:** All creatures in contact with the fog suffer 1 damage per round.
- **Creatures with less than 5 Hit Dice:** Must also **save versus death** (once per round of contact) or die.
