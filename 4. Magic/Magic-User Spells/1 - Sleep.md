**Duration:** 4d4 turns

It causes creatures (except undead to fall into a magical slumber. The spell may target either:

1. A single creature with 4+1 Hit Dice (see ***Hit Point Modifiers***).
2. A total of 2d8 Hit Dice of creatures of 4 HD or lower each.

When targeting creatures of 4 HD or less, the following rules apply:

- **Weakest first:** Targets with the least HD are affected first.
- **HD:** Treat monsters with less than 1 HD as having 1 HD and monsters with a fixed hit point bonus as having the flat HD. (For example, a 3+2 HD monster would be treated as having 3 HD.)

**Killing:** A single attack with a bladed weapon can kill a creature enchanted by this spell.

**Awakening:** Enchanted creatures can be forcefully awakened (e.g., by slapping).
