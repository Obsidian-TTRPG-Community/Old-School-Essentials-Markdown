# Invisibility 10’ Radius

*3rd Level Magic-User Spell*

**Duration:** Permanent (but may be broken; see below)

**Range:** 120’

A selected creature and all creatures within 10’ of it become invisible:

- **Area:** The 10’ radius area of the spell’s effect moves with the chosen creature.
- **Exiting the area:** Subjects that move more than 10’ away from the chosen creature become visible.
- **Entering the area:** Creatures that move into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible.
- **Gear:** Any gear a subject is carrying is also rendered invisible. Items subsequently put down become visible. Carried light sources become invisible, but the emitted light does not.
- **Breaking the invisibility:** If a subject attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility is broken for that subject.
