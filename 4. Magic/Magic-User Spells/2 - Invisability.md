# Invisibility

*2nd Level Magic-User Spell*

**Duration:** Permanent (but may be broken, see below)

**Range:** 240’

The caster or another creature or object within range becomes invisible:

- **If cast on a creature:** Any gear the subject is carrying is also rendered invisible (this includes clothing and armor). Items subsequently put down become visible. If the subject attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility is broken, ending the spell.
- **If cast on an object:** The invisibility is permanent.
- **Light sources:** If a light source is made invisible (either as part of a creature’s gear or as an individual object), the light it casts is unaffected.
