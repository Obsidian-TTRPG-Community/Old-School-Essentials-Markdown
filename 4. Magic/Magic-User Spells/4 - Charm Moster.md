*4th Level Magic-User Spell*

This spell places a charm upon either 3d6 creatures of 3 HD or less or a single creature of more than 3 HD. Each subject must make a **save versus spells** or be charmed as follows:

- **Friendship:** Charmed creatures regard the caster as a close friend and will come to the caster’s defense.
- **Commands:** If they share a language, the caster may give charmed creatures commands, which they will obey.
- **Subject’s nature:** Charmed creatures may resist commands that contradict their habits or alignment.
- **Suicidal commands:** Are always refused.

**Restrictions:** Undead are not affected.

**Duration:** The charm lasts indefinitely, but the subject is allowed to make further **saves versus spells** at intervals, depending on its INT score. If one of these saves succeeds, the spell ends.

- **INT 3–8:** New save once every month.
- **INT 9–12:** New save each week.
- **INT 13–18:** New save once every day.
