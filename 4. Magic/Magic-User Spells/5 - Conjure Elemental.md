# Conjure Elemental

*5th Level Magic-User Spell*

**Duration:** Permanent (until dismissed or slain)

**Range:** 240’

A 16 Hit Dice elemental—a being formed of pure elemental matter—is summoned from an elemental plane of the caster’s choice (air, earth, fire, water) to do the caster’s bidding.

- **Materials:** The summons require a large volume of the appropriate element.
- **Concentration:** Is required to command an elemental.
- **Dismissing:** While control over the elemental is maintained, the caster may dismiss it at any time, sending it back to its plane of origin.
- **Disruption:** If the caster moves at more than half speed or their concentration is disturbed, the command over the elemental ends. It is, henceforth, a free-willed entity and will immediately try to kill the caster and any who get in its way.
- **Dispelling:** A conjured elemental may be dispelled by *dispel magic* or *dispel evil*.

**Restrictions:** The caster may summon at most one elemental from each plane in a single day.
