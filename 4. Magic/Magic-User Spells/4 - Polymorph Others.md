# Polymorph Others

*4th Level Magic-User Spell*

**Duration:** Permanent

**Range:** 60’

A living subject is changed into another type of creature, as chosen by the caster:

- **HD:** The spell fails if the new form’s HD is more than twice the subject’s HD.
- **Hit points:** The transformation does not alter the subject’s hit points.
- **Abilities:** The subject truly becomes the new form: all special abilities are acquired, along with behavioral patterns, tendencies, and intelligence.
- **Specific individuals:** The spell cannot be used to duplicate a specific individual.
- **Reversion:** If the subject dies, it returns to its original form.
- **An unwilling subject:** May **save versus spells** to negate the effect.
