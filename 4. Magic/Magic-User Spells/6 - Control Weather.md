# Control Weather

*6th Level Magic-User Spell*

**Duration:** Concentration

**Range:** 240 yards around the caster

By concentrating (no movement allowed), the caster causes one of the following conditions to manifest in the surrounding area. This spell only functions outdoors.

- **Calm:** Clears bad weather (though side-effects—e.g. mud after rain—remain.)
- **Extreme heat:** Dries up snow or mud (including *transmute rock to mud. Creatures in the area move at half normal rate.
- **Fog:** Visibility drops to 20’. Creatures in the fog move at half their normal rate. At the referee’s option, they may also have a chance of getting lost.
- **High winds:** Movement rates are halved. Missile fire and flight are impossible. High winds may be used to increase the sailing speed of ships by 50%, if they travel with the wind. In sandy areas, may cause a sandstorm, reducing visibility to 20’.
- **Rain:** -2 penalty to missile attacks. Mud forms in 3 turns, halving movement rates.
- **Snow:** Visibility drops to 20’. Movement rates are halved. Bodies of water may freeze. After the snow thaws, mud remains and still impedes movement.
- **Tornado:** Conjures a whirlwind that the caster directs, moving 120’ per round and attacking as directed (see stats below). Ships caught in a tornado have a 75% chance of suffering 12 points of hull damage.
