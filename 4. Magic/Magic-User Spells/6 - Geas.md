# Geas (Remove Geas)

*6th Level Magic-User Spell*

**Duration:** Permanent / Instant (*remove geas*)

**Range:** 30’

The caster commands a subject to perform or avoid performing a specific action.

- **Examples:** Bringing a specific item to the caster, eating or drinking without restraint, and keeping a certain fact secret.
- **Impossible or deadly tasks:** The prescribed *geas* must not be impossible or directly deadly—if such a *geas* is cast, it affects the caster, instead.
- **Saving throw:** The subject may **save versus spells**, to avoid coming under the spell’s effect.
- **If the save fails:** The subject must follow the stipulated course of action or suffer gradually increasing (and eventually fatal) penalties determined by the referee (e.g. penalties to attack, ability score reductions, inability to memorize spells, physical torment and feebleness, etc.).

## Reversed: Remove Geas

Can dispel an active *geas* spell and any incurred penalties. A *geas* placed by a lower-level caster is automatically dispelled. A *geas* created by a higher level caster has a 5% chance per level difference of not being dispelled.
