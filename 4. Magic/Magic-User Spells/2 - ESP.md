# ESP

*2nd Level Magic-User Spell*

**Duration:** 12 turns

**Range:** 60’

This spell grants the caster the ability to perceive and understand the thoughts of other living creatures.

- **Focus for 1 turn:** To pick up thoughts, the caster must focus their concentration in one direction for one turn.
- **After this turn:** The thoughts of all creatures within range in that direction can be perceived.
- **Multiple creatures:** If multiple creatures are within range in the direction being focused on, the caster perceives an incomprehensible mix of all their thoughts. If the caster focuses on an additional turn, they can filter out and understand a single creature’s thoughts.
- **Meaning:** The caster can magically understand thoughts in languages they do not speak.
- **Obstructions:** *ESP' is obstructed by a thin layer of lead or by rock 2’ thick or greater.*
