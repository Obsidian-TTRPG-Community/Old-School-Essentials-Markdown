# Silence 15’ Radius

*2nd Level Cleric Spell*

**Duration:** 12 turns

**Range:** 180’

A 15’ radius area is rendered utterly silent.

- **Within the area:** All sound is prevented. Conversation and spellcasting are impossible.
- **Noise from outside the area:** Can be heard by those within it.
- **Casting upon a creature:** *Silence* may be cast upon a creature, which must **save versus spells**. If the save fails, the 15’ radius area of silence moves with the creature. If the save succeeds, the spell’s effect remains stationary—the targeted creature may move out of it.
