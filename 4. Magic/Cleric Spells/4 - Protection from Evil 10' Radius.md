# Protection from Evil 10’ Radius (C)

*4th Level Cleric Spell*

**Duration:** 12 turns

**Range:** 10’ around the caster

This spell wards the caster and all allies within 10’ from attacks by creatures of another alignment, as follows:

- **Bonuses:** Those warded gain a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks or special abilities of affected creatures.
- **Affected creatures’ attacks:** Against those warded are penalized by -1.
- **Enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures:** The spell additionally prevents such creatures from making melee attacks against those warded, though they may still make ranged attacks. If any of the warded party engages such a creature in melee, this protection is broken (those warded still gain the save and attack bonuses mentioned above).
