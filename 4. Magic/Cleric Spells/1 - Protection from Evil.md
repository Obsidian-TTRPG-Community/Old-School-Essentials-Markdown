# Protection from Evil (C)

*1st Level Cleric Spell*

**Duration:** 12 turns

**Range:** The caster

This spell wards the caster from attacks by creatures of another alignment, as follows:

- **Bonuses:** The caster gains a +1 bonus to saving throws against attacks or special abilities of affected creatures.
- **Affected creaturesâ€™ attacks:** Against the caster are penalized by -1.
- **Enchanted, constructed, or summoned creatures:** The spell additionally prevents such creatures from attacking the caster in melee, though they may still make ranged attacks. If the caster engages such a creature in melee, this protection is broken (the caster still gains the save and attack bonuses mentioned above).
