# Water Vessels

## Vessel Dimensions

A ship’s ***beam*** is its width, and its ***draft*** is the depth it extends beneath the water.

## Historical Periods

The vessels described in this section span various historical periods, from the ancient period to the medieval. Not all types of vessels may be available in a campaign setting.

### Descriptions

**Lifeboat:** A small boat with a mast that folds down for storage. Small ships usually have 1–2 lifeboats, while larger ships may have 3–4. A lifeboat weighs 5,000 coins and reduces the ship's cargo capacity on which it is carried by this much. A lifeboat is usually equipped with rations to feed ten human-sized beings for one week.

**Longship:** A narrow ship that may be used in rivers, coastal waters, or the open seas. A longship may be rowed or sailed, depending on the conditions. The crew typically fills the role of oarsmen, sailors, and fighters as needed.

**Sailing ship, large:** A large, seaworthy vessel with up to three masts. Usually, it has multiple decks and raised “castles” at the bow and stern.

**Sailing ship, small:** A small, seaworthy vessel with a single mast.

**Troop transport (large, small):** These ships have similar dimensions and characteristics to normal sailing ships but are specially designed to carry troops, mounts, and equipment of war as their cargo.

**Warship (large, small):** These ships have similar dimensions and characteristics to normal sailing ships but are specially designed to carry mercenaries and war gear.

### Descriptions

**Boat, river:** Riverboats are either rowed or pushed with poles. The cost of the boat increases by 1,000gp if it has a roof (to protect passengers or cargo).

**Boat, sailing:** A small boat typically used for fishing in lakes or coastal waters.

**Canoe:** A small boat made of hide or canvas stretched over a wooden frame. Because of its small size and lightweight construction, a canoe may be carried by two people (weighing 500 coins).

**Galley, large:** A long ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.

**Galley, small:** A ship with a shallow draft and a single, square-sailed mast.

**Galley, war:** A large, specially constructed galley that is generally a fleet’s flagship. War galleys are always fitted with a ram (comes with the basic cost) and have a full deck above the rowers. They have two masts and 10’–20’ wide wooden towers rising 15’–20’ above the bow and stern.

**Raft, makeshift:** Given sufficient wood, characters may build a makeshift raft in 1–3 days per 10’ square section (up to a maximum size of 20’ × 30’).

**Raft, professional:** A professionally built raft has raised sides, a basic steering oar, and some shelter for goods or passengers. Such a raft may be up to 30’ × 40’. Professionally built rafts are sometimes floated downstream with cargo and then broken down and sold for the value of their wood (25cp per square foot).

### Ship Modifications

The following modifications may be made to an existing ship:

- **Warship:** A sailing ship may be converted into a warship or troop transport of the same size. The modification costs one-third of the ship’s original cost.
- **Catapult:** A catapult may be added to a galley, longship, or warship.
- **Ram:** A ram may be added to a large or small galley (a war galley already has a ram fitted).

## Ship Weaponry

| Item                 | Cost (gp) |
| :------------------- | :-------: |
| Catapult             |    100    |
| Catapult shot        |     5     |
| Catapult shot, pitch |    25     |
| Ram, large galley    |  10,000   |
| Ram, small galley    |   3,000   |

### Rams

It can be used against ships or giant sea monsters. Small individuals cannot be targeted.

**Attack rolls:** These are made using a THAC0 of 19 [0], occurring simultaneously in the combat sequence as missile fire.

**Attack modifiers:** May be applied for weather conditions, maneuverability, etc.

**Large or war galley:** Deals 1d6+5 × 10 hull points damage against ships and 6d6 hit points damage against monsters.

**Small galley:** Deals 1d4+4 × 10 hull points damage against ships and 3d8 hit points damage against monsters.

### Catapults

Fire either large rocks or flaming pitch.

**Weight:** A catapult plus twenty shot rounds weighs 10,000 coins (subtracted from the ship’s cargo allowance).

**Range:** 150–300 yards.

**Attack rolls and rate of fire:** Depend on the number of crew manning the catapult:

- **2 crew (minimum):** Attacks with THAC0 19 [0]. Fires every 10 rounds.
- **3 crew:** Attacks with THAC0 19 [0]. Fires every 8 rounds.
- **4 crew (maximum):** Attacks with THAC0 17 [+2]. Fires every 5 rounds.

**Attack modifiers:** May be applied for weather conditions, maneuverability, etc.

#### Catapult Shot

Inflicts 3d6 hull damage against ships.

#### Catapult Shot, Pitch

Sets a 10’×10’ area of a ship on fire. The burning does 1d6 hull points of damage per turn (for at least one turn) and will spread to other areas of the ship if not extinguished. A fire may be put out by five crew in 3 turns, ten in 2 turns, or fifteen in 1 turn.
