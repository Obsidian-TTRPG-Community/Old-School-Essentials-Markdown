# Mercenaries

Hired soldiers who will guard, patrol, and otherwise serve in wilderness settings, but only as part of a larger force, not an adventuring party. Mercenaries do not accompany characters on adventures.

Note that as mercenaries are hired by a character to perform specific services, they are not treated as retainers and thus do not count toward a character’s maximum number of retainers.

## Locating Mercenaries

Mercenaries can be located by posting notices of help wanted. The response will depend on the availability of suitable troops in the area and the offer made.

## Wages

**Outside of wartime:** As listed below.

**During wartime:** All wages are doubled.

## Upkeep

The monthly rate of pay includes food and essential gear. Most mercenaries already have weapons and armor when hired, though their employer may give them additional equipment. Armorers are required to repair mercenaries’ armor and weapons (see ***Specialists***).
