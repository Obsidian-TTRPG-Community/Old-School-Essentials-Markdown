# Player Characters

- **Game Statistics:** Player characters are described, in game terms, by a set of statistics that define their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses in the game world.
- **Creating a Character:** To create a character, you'll first need a character sheetâ€”a sheet of paper on which to record all information about the new character.
- **Ability Scores:** A character's score in each ability determines whether they have any bonuses or penalties associated with various actions in the game.
- **Alignment:** All beings, whether PCs, NPCs, or monsters, adhere to one of three philosophies or spheres of behavior, known as alignments.
- **Languages:** The native languages a player character speaks are determined by the character's class.
