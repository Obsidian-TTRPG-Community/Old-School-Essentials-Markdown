# Awarding XP

All characters who return from an adventure alive receive experience points (XP). XP is gained from two sources: treasure recovered and monsters defeated.

## Recovered Treasure

Treasure that PCs bring back from an adventure is the primary means by which they gain XP—usually accounting for ¾ or more of the total XP earned.

**Non-magical treasure:** Characters gain 1 XP per 1 gold piece (gp) value of the treasure.

**Magical treasure:** Does not grant XP.

## Defeated Monsters

All monsters defeated by the party (i.e., slain, outsmarted, captured, scared away, etc.) grant XP based on how powerful they are. See the table below.

**Base XP:** The XP value of a monster is determined by its Hit Dice.

**Bonus XP / ability:** A monster’s XP value is increased for each special ability it has. Special abilities are indicated by asterisks following the monster’s HD rating.

**Monsters with bonus hit points:** Monsters whose HD are notated as a number of dice plus a fixed hit point bonus (e.g., HD 4+2) are more powerful and are listed separately in the table. For example, a monster with 2 HD is worth 20 XP, but a monster with 2+2 HD is worth 25 XP.

**Higher HD monsters:** For each HD above 21, add 250 XP to the Base and Bonus amounts.

**Extraordinary peril bonus:** A monster defeated under hazardous circumstances may be treated as one Hit Dice category higher on the table.

## Division of Experience

The XP awards for treasures recovered and monsters defeated are totaled and divided evenly between all characters who survived the adventure—this includes retainers (see ***Retainers***).

Awarded XP is always divided evenly, irrespective of how the players decide to split the treasure.

## Bonuses and Penalties

The referee may optionally grant XP bonuses to players who did exceptionally well. Likewise, players who did not do their share of the work may be penalized.
