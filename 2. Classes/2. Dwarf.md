Dwarves are stout demihumans, about 4’ tall and weighing about 150 pounds. They live in clans, each with its underground stronghold. Clans are usually on good terms and will cooperate in times of need. Dwarves are known for their stubbornness, practicality, and love of fine craftsmanship, gold, hearty food, and strong drink. Their hair and long beards are black, grey, or brown, and their skin is earthy brown. They are strongly resilient to magic, as indicated in their saving throw values.

## Combat

Dwarves can use all types of armor. Their stature means they can only use small or normal-sized weapons. They cannot use longbows or two-handed swords.

## Detect Construction Tricks

As expert miners, dwarves have a 2-in-6 chance of being able to detect new construction, sliding walls, or sloping passages when searching.

## Detect Room Traps

Due to their expertise with construction, dwarves have a 2-in-6 chance of detecting non-magical room traps when searching (see ***Dungeon Adventuring.

## Infravision

Dwarves have infravision to 60’ (see ***Darkness*** under ***Hazards and Challenges***).

## Listening at Doors

Dwarves have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see ***Dungeon Adventuring***).

## After Reaching 9th Level

A dwarf may construct a subterranean stronghold delved beneath hills or mountains. Other dwarves may come to live under the rule of the character, establishing a new clan.

A dwarf ruler may only hire dwarven mercenaries. Specialists and retainers of any race may be hired.
