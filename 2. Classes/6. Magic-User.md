Magic-users are adventurers whose study of secret arcane lore has taught them how to cast spells and wield powerful magic items. Magic-users begin with knowledge of a single spell but gain access to highly potent magic as they advance.

## Arcane Magic

See ***Spells*** for full details on arcane magic.

**Magical research:** A magic-user of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to add new spells to their spell book and to research other magical effects. When a magic-user reaches 9th level, they can also create magic items.

**Spell casting:** Magic-users carry spell books containing the formulae for arcane spells. The level progression table (below) shows the number of spells in the magic-user’s spell book and the number they may memorize, determined by the character’s experience level. Thus, a 1st level magic-user has one spell in their spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The list of spells available to magic-users is found in ***Magic-User Spells***.

**Using magic items:** As spell casters, magic-users can use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by arcane spell casters (e.g., magic wands).

## Combat

Magic-users can only use daggers and cannot use shields or wear any armor. This makes them very vulnerable in combat.

## After Reaching 11th Level

A magic-user may construct a stronghold (usually in the form of a tower). 1d6 apprentices of levels 1–3 will then arrive to study under the magic-user.
