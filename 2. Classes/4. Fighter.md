Fighters are adventurers trained in warfare and combat. In a group of adventurers, the role of fighters is to battle monsters and defend other characters.

## Combat

Fighters can use all types of weapons and armor.

## Stronghold

Any time a fighter wishes (and has sufficient money), they can build a castle or stronghold and control the surrounding lands.

## After Reaching 9th Level

A fighter may be granted a title such as Baron or Baroness. The land under the fighterâ€™s control is then known as a Barony.
