Elves are slender, fey demihumans with pointed ears. They typically weigh about 120 pounds and are between 5 and 5½ feet tall. Elves are seldom met in human settlements, preferring to feast and make merry in the woods. They are dangerous enemies if crossed, as they are masters of both swords and spells. Elves are fascinated by spells and beautifully constructed magic items and love to collect both.

**Prime requisites:** An elf with at least 13 INT and STR gains a 5% bonus to experience. An elf with an INT of at least 16 and a STR of at least 13 receives a +10% XP bonus.

## Arcane Magic

See **Spells** for full details on arcane magic.

**Magical research:** An elf of any level may spend time and money on magical research. This allows them to add new spells to their spell book and to research other magical effects. When an elf reaches 9th level, they can also create magic items.

**Spell casting:** Elves carry spell books containing the formulae for arcane spells. The level progression table (below) shows the number of spells in the elf’s spell book and the number they may memorize, determined by the character’s experience level. Thus, a 1st level elf has one spell in their spell book, selected by the referee (who may allow the player to choose). The list of spells available to elves is under ***Magic-User Spells*** (elves have the same spell selection as magic-users).

**Using magic items:** As spell casters, elves can use magic scrolls of spells on their spell list. They can also use items that may only be used by arcane spell casters (e.g., magic wands).

## Combat

Elves can use all types of weapons and armor.

## Detect Secret Doors

Elves have a 2-in-6 chance of locating secret or hidden doors when searching (see ***Dungeon Adventuring***).

## Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis

Elves are immune to the paralyzing effect of ghouls’ attacks.

## Infravision

Elves have infravision to 60’ (see ***Darkness*** under ***Hazards and Challenges***).

## Listening at Doors

Elves have a 2-in-6 chance of hearing noises (see ***Dungeon Adventuring***).

## After Reaching 9th Level

An elf may construct a stronghold in the depths of the forest, blending in with the natural environment of a site of great beauty, for example, in the treetops, beside a serene valley, or hidden behind a waterfall. Whatever material it is made of, the construction costs as much as similar work in stone due to the exquisite quality of craftsmanship involved.

Forest animals within a 5-mile radius of the completed stronghold will become friends with the elves. They may warn of intruders, carry messages and news, etc. In exchange for this friendship, the elf must protect the animals from harm.

An elf ruler may only hire elven mercenaries. Specialists and retainers of any race may be hired.
