# Adventuring Parties

This procedure generates parties of NPC adventurers. As the process is fairly involved, referees may wish to pre-generate some NPC parties for use in random encounters. The following general details apply to all types of NPC parties described:

- **Spells:** If spell casters are present, choose or roll their memorized spells.
- **Equipment:** Normal adventuring gear.
- **Treasure:** Treasure types U + V, shared among the group.
- **Marching order:** Decided by the referee.

If the classes presented in this document are not used, the referee should replace the listed classes with equivalents in the campaign.
