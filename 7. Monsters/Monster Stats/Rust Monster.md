- **Rusting:** Metal that touches a rust monster (e.g., weapons that hit it, or armor struck by a feeler) crumbles instantly to rust. Magic items have a 10% chance per “plus”, to be unaffected on each successful hit. Each time a magic item is affected, it loses one “plus”.
- **Smell metal:** Attracted by the scent.
