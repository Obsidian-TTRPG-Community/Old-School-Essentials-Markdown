# Lycanthrope

Shapechangers with a human and an animal form.

- **Human form:** Have physical characteristics reminiscent of the associated animal type.
- **Mundane damage immunity:** In animal form, can only harmed by silver weapons or magic.
- **Languages:** In human form, can speak normally. In animal form, they can only speak with animals of the associated type.
- **Armor:** Not used because it hinders shape-changing.
- **Summon animals:** Can summon 1–2 animals of the associated type from the surrounding area (wererats summon giant rats. These arrive in 1d4 rounds.
- **Wolfsbane:** If hit, must save versus poison or flee in terror.
- **Reversion:** If killed, a lycanthrope reverts to its human form.
- **Scent:** Horses and some other animals can smell lycanthropes and will become afraid.
- **Infection:** A character who loses over ½ their hit points from lycanthropes’ natural attacks (i.e., bites, claws) contracts lycanthropy. Humans become were-creatures of the same type (run by the referee, henceforth); non-humans die. The disease takes full effect in 2d12 days, showing signs of infection after half the time.
