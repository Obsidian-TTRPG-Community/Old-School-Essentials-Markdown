# Dragon

A proud, ancient race of gigantic, carnivorous, winged reptiles. There are many subspecies of dragons, many of which are distinguished by the color of their scales. All dragons are egg-layers and hoard treasure in their lairs, far from areas of human civilization.

- **Behavior:** Chaotic dragons usually try to eat humans but may sometimes capture them. Neutral dragons may attack or ignore humans. Lawful dragons may aid parties worthy of the honor.

- **Pride:** Dragons are immensely proud creatures and will always listen to flattery.

- **Attack pattern:** A dragon always attacks first with its breath weapon, then either breathes again or makes melee attacks (equal chance of either).

- Breath weapon:

   

  It can be used up to three times per day. All caught in the area suffer damage equal to the dragon’s current hit points (

  save versus breath

   

  for half). Shapes of breath weapon:

  - **Cloud:** 50’ long, 40’ wide, 20’ high.
  - **Cone:** 2’ wide at the mouth, 30’ wide at the far end.
  - **Line:** 5’ wide along the whole length.

- **Energy immunity:** Unharmed by their own breath weapon or lesser versions thereof. Automatically save versus similar attack forms. (For example, a red dragon is immune to flaming oil and suffers half damage from *fire ball* spells.)

- **Language and spells:** Some dragons are able to speak (their tongue plus Common). The chance is listed by subspecies. Those who can speak can also cast randomly selected magic-user spells(the listed number and level of spells).

- **Sleeping:** The chance of a dragon being asleep when encountered on the ground is listed by subspecies. A sleeping dragon may be attacked for one round with a +2 bonus to hit. Dragons may sometimes pretend to be asleep!

- **Subduing:** Will surrender if reduced to 0hp by non-lethal attacks (see ***Subduing, admitting that it has been defeated. (Subdual damage does not reduce the damage done by the breath weapon.) A subdued dragon will attempt to escape or attack its captors, if the opportunity presents itself or if given a suicidal command. A subdued dragon may be sold for up to 1,000gp per hp.

- **Age:** The following stats describe dragons of average size. Younger dragons may have up to 3 HD less and ¼ or ½ as much treasure. Older dragons may have up to 3 HD more and twice as much treasure.

- **Lairs:** A dragon’s treasure is always kept in its well-hidden lair and is seldom unguarded.
