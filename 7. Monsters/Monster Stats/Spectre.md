- **Undead:** Make no noise until they attack. Immune to effects that affect living creatures (e.g., poison). Immune to mind-affecting or mind-reading spells (e.g., *charm*, *hold*, *sleep*).
- **Mundane damage immunity:** Can only be harmed by magical attacks.
- **Energy drain:** A successfully hit target permanently loses two experience levels (or Hit Dice). This incurs a loss of two Hit Dice of hit points, as well as all other benefits due to the drained levels (e.g., spells, saving throws, etc.). A character’s XP is reduced to the lowest amount for the new level. A person drained of all levels becomes a spectre next night, under the control of the spectre that killed them.
