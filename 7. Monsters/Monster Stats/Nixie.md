- **Shy:** Will try to charm intruders rather than entering combat.
- **Weapons:** Daggers and small tridents (as spears).
- **Charm:** 10 nixies together can cast a charm to enchant a victim to serve them for one year. **Save versus spells** or be charmed: move towards the nixies (resisting those who try to prevent it); defend the nixies; obey the nixies’ commands (if understood); unable to cast spells or use magic items; unable to harm the nixies. Killing the nixies breaks the charm.
- **Summon giant bass:** Each nixie can summon one fish to aid in combat (see ***Giant Bass***).
- **Bestow water breathing:** Can cast upon charmed slaves. Lasts for one day, then must be refreshed.
