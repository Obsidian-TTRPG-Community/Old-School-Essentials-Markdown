# Water Termite

Giant (1’–5’ long), wood-eating, aquatic insects with a sack to take in and jet out water. Prone to feeding on passing ships. Only attack creatures if cornered.

- **Irritant spray:** Above water; maximum once a turn. Can spray one target: **save versus poison** or stunned for 1 turn.
- **Ink cloud:** Underwater; maximum once a turn. When escaping, it can emit a cloud of black ink to confuse attackers.
- **Eat ships:** Cling to the bottom of a vessel. Each individual inflicts 1d3 hull damage and then drops off.
- **Noticing ship damage:** 50% chance per round of spotting leaks.
