# Thoul

Magical monstrosities that look like hobgoblins (except on close inspection) but combine the powers of ghouls and trolls. Sometimes, they live among hobgoblins.

- **Paralysis:** Successful attacks cause paralysis for 2d4 turns (**save versus paralysis** negates). Elves and creatures larger than ogres are unaffected. After paralysing a target, thouls will attack others.
- **Regeneration:** A damaged thoul gains 1 hit point at the start of each round, as long as it is alive.
