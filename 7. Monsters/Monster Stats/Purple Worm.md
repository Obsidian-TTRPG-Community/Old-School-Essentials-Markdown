- **Swallow whole:** A bite attack roll of 20, or 4 or more than the target number required, indicates that a human-sized (or smaller) victim is swallowed. Inside the worm’s belly: suffer 3d6 damage per round (until the worm dies); may attack with sharp weapons at -4 to hit; body digested in 6 turns after death.
- **Poison:** Causes death (**save vs. poison**).
- **In restricted spaces:** May not always be able to bite and sting at once.
