- **Hateful:** Attempt to kill any creatures they encounter.
- **Surprise:** On a 1–4, due to the ability to change color to match their surroundings. Lurk by rock walls and await victims.
- **Nauseating stench:** Oils on the skin have a smell that sickens humans and demihumans: **save versus poison** or suffer -2 to hit, while in melee with troglodytes.
