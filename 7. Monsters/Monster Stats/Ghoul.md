- **Paralysis:** For 2d4 turns (**save versus paralysis**). Elves and creatures larger than ogres are unaffected. After paralyzing a target, ghouls will attack others.
- **Undead:** Make no noise, until they attack. Immune to effects that affect living creatures (e.g. poison). Immune to mind-affecting or mind-reading spells (e.g. *charm*, *hold*, *sleep*).
