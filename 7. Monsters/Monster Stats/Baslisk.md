- **Surprise:** Characters surprised by a basilisk meet its gaze.
- **Petrifying touch:** Anyone touched by a basilisk is turned to stone (**save vs. petrify**).
- **Petrifying gaze:** Anyone meeting a basilisk’s gaze is turned to stone (**save versus petrify**). Unless averting their eyes or using a mirror, characters in melee are affected each round.
- **Averting eyes:** -4 penalty to-hit; the basilisk gains a +2 bonus to attack.
- **Mirrors:** The reflection of a basilisk is harmless. Fighting by looking in a mirror incurs a -1 penalty to attack. If a basilisk sees its own reflection (2-in-6 chance), it must save or be petrified.
