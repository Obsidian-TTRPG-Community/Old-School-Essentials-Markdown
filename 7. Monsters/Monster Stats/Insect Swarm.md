- **Type and locomotion:** A swarm may comprise creepers (e.g., spiders, ants, centipedes) or flyers (e.g., bees, hornets). Some swarms can both types of movement (e.g., beetles, locusts).
- **Size:** 10’ × 30’ area, typically.
- **Immunity:** Only harmed by fire, extreme cold, *sleep* spells (affect the whole swarm), smoke (drives off), or other attacks as the referee wishes.
- **Swarm attack:** Automatically damages characters within swarm area: 2hp if wearing armor, 4hp without.
- **Warding off:** Characters inside the swarm who defend themselves by brandishing a weapon (or similar) suffer half damage from the swarm. A brandished torch damages the swarm.
- **Escaping:** On exiting the swarm, characters continue to suffer half damage until 3 rounds are spent swatting the attached insects.
- **Diving into water:** Suffer damage for one round, then attached insects drown.
- **Pursuit:** An angry (i.e., damaged) swarm will pursue characters until they are out of sight or inaccessible.
