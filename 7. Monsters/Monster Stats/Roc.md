Gigantic birds of prey that nest in the highest peaks of isolated mountain ranges. Will attack intruders, if approached carelessly.

- **Alignment reaction:** -1 to reaction rolls versus Neutral characters; -2 versus Chaotic characters.

- **Eggs:** 1d6 eggs or chicks in 50% of nests.
- **Trainable:** Can be trained if captured when young.
