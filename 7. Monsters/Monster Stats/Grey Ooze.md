- **Blend in with stone:** Difficult to tell apart from wet stone.
- **Acid:** After a successful attack, sticks to the victim and exudes acid. The acid destroys normal armor immediately and inflicts 2d8 damage per round. (Magic armor is dissolved in one turn.)
- **Energy immunity:** Unharmed by cold or fire.
