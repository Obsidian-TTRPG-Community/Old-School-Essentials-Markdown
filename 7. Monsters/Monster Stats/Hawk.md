# Hawk

Birds of prey that drift on high currents of air and hunt prey on the ground.

- **Swoop:** Can dive onto victims visible from above. If the victim is surprised, the attack inflicts double damage. On an attack roll of 18 or more, the victim can be carried away (if of appropriate size).
- **Trainable:** Can be trained as guards or hunting animals.

## Giant Hawk

As big as a great dog. If hungry, may attack humans or similar-sized creatures.
