- **Blink:** In combat, teleport close to an enemy, attack, then reappear 1d4 × 10’ away. If they have initiative, can blink away without the opponent being able to counter-attack.
- **Disappear:** If in serious danger, the pack can flee by entirely disappearing.
- **Hate warp beasts:** Always attack.
