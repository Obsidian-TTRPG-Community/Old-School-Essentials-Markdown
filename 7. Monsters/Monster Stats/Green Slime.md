- **Surprise:** Drops down on surprised characters from above.
- **Acid:** When in contact with a victim, sticks on and exudes acid. The acid destroys wood or metal (including armor) in 6 rounds, but cannot affect stone.
- **Consume flesh:** Once in contact with flesh for 6 rounds, the victim is turned into green slime in a further 1d4 rounds.
- **Removing:** Once stuck on a victim, can only be removed by fire. This inflicts half damage to the victim and half to the slime.
- **Immunity:** Unharmed by all attacks except cold or fire.
