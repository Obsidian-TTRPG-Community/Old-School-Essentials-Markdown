------

- **Immunity:** Unharmed by all attacks except cold or fire.
- **Division:** Lightning or attacks with weapons cause the jelly to divide into 1d4+1 2HD jellies that do half damage.
- **Acid:** After a successful attack, sticks to the victim and exudes acid. The acid inflicts 2d6 damage per round to flesh and destroys cloth, leather, or wood in one round. (Stone and metal are unaffected.)
- **Seep:** Can squeeze through small holes and cracks.
