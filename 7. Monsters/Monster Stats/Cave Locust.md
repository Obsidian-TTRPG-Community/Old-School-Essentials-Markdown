- **Blend in with stone:** May be overlooked or mistaken for statues, due to their stony coloration.
- **Shriek:** If attacked or frightened, shriek to warn others. This may attract wandering monsters (20% chance per round).
- **Jump:** Very skittish. If attacked, usually flee by jumping up to 60’ and then flying away. 50% chance of jumping at a random opponent, in which case treat the jump as an attack.
- **Spit:** Used defensively. 10’ range. Target treated as AC 9 [10]. The affected character is covered in stinking spittle: and unable to act for 1 turn (**save versus poison**). Until the goo is washed off, others who come within 5’ must also **save versus poison** or be violently sick.
- **Poison immunity:** Immune to yellow mold and most poisons, due to their habit of eating fungi.
