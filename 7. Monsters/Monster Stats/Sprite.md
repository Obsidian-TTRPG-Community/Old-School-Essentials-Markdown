# Sprite

1’ tall, winged humanoids related to pixies and elves. They are shy but driven by curiosity and their odd sense of humor.

- **Curse:** Five sprites can collectively curse a target (no attack roll; **save versus spells**). The referee determines the effect but will always be used to comical effect (e.g., target trips, target’s nose grows).
- **Pranksters:** Even if attacked, sprites have no interest in killing, merely in making practical jokes.
