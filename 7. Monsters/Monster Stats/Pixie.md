- **Invisible:** Naturally invisible, but may choose to reveal themselves. May remain invisible when attacking: cannot be attacked in the first round; in subsequent rounds, may be attacked at -2 to hit (locatable by faint shadows and air movement).
- **Surprise:** Always surprise, if invisible.
- **Limited flight:** Small wings only allow 3 turns of flight. Must rest 1 turn after flying.
