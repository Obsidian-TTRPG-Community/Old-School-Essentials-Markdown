- **Aggressive:** Usually attack on sight. Always attack intruders within 30’ of their hive.
- **Die after attacking:** On a successful sting attack, a killer bee dies.
- **Poison:** Causes death (**save vs. poison**).
- **Lodged stinger:** Inflicts 1 damage per round, as the stinger works its way in. A round can be spent to remove it.
- **Queen:** A 2HD queen lives in the hive. The queen does not die when she stings.
- **Guards:** At least 10 bees (4 or more of which have 1HD) remain in or near the hive to protect the queen.
- **Honey:** Magical honey (around 2 pints) may be found in the hive. It heals 1d4 hit points if eaten (in its entirety).
