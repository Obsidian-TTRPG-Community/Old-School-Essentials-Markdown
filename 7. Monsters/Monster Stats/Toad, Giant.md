- **Surprise:** On a 1–3, in forests or dark dungeons, due to the ability to change color to match their surrounding.
- **Sticky tongue:** Attack up to 15’ away. On a hit, prey (up to dwarf size) is dragged to the mouth and bitten.
- **Swallow whole:** A natural 20 attack roll indicates a small victim is swallowed. Inside the toad’s belly: suffer 1d6 damage per round (until the toad dies); may attack with sharp weapons at -4 to hit; body digested in 6 turns after death.
