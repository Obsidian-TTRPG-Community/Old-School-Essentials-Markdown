# Herd Animal

Wild animals that live in large, grazing herds. The exact type depends on the terrain.

- **Stampede:** Herds of 20 or more can trample those in their path. 3-in-4 chance each round. +4 to hit human-sized or smaller creatures. 1d20 damage.
- **Males:** In groups of 3 or more, only 1-in-4 are males. These have 1d4 extra hit points and protect the herd.
- **Females and young:** Flee from danger. Females do not have a butt attack. Young have half-normal hit points.

## Large Herd Animal

For example: elk or moose.
