# Morale (Optional Rule)

The referee decides whether monsters or NPCs surrender or run away in combat. The following system may be utilized.

## Morale Rating

Monsters are rated for morale with a number from 2–12. This represents their courage in battle. Higher morale scores indicate more fearless monsters.

**A score of 2:** Means the monster will not fight. No morale checks should be made.

**A score of 12:** Means the monster fights to the death, never checking morale.

## Morale Checks

The referee rolls 2d6 and compares the result against the monster’s morale score:

- **Higher than morale score:** The monster will surrender or attempt to flee.
- **Equal to or lower than morale score:** The monster will continue to fight.

**Two successes:** If a monster makes two successful morale checks in an encounter, it will fight until killed, with no further checks necessary.

## When to Check Morale

Monsters make morale checks (rolled by the referee) in two circumstances:

**First death on side:** The first time one of their number is killed in battle.

**Side half incapacitated:** When half the monsters are incapacitated (slain, paralyzed, etc.).

## Situational Adjustments

Based on the situation, the referee may apply morale modifiers from –2 to +2. For example, the side losing a battle might suffer a –1 morale penalty, while the side winning may gain a +1 bonus.

**Scores of 2 or 12:** Adjustments are never applied to monsters with a morale of 2 or 12.

## Mercenary Morale

Mercenaries (see ***Mercenaries***) have a morale rating and check morale exactly like monsters.

**Morale rating:** Determined solely by the type of troops; see below. The CHA of the hiring character has no influence.

**Modifiers:** The referee may penalize mercenaries’ morale in poor conditions (e.g., low wages, abuse, frequent death) or raise it in good conditions (e.g., riches, glory in battle).

| Troop Type           | Morale |
| :------------------- | :----: |
| Untrained, militia   |   6    |
| Barbarian horde      |   7    |
| Trained warriors     |   8    |
| Mounted              |   +1   |
| Elite troops         |   +1   |
| Fanatics, berserkers |   +2   |

## Retainer Morale

Retainers signed up to work as adventurers, so are not frightened off at the first sign of danger. Retainers do not make morale checks in combat, but a loyalty check may be required in extreme peril (see ***Retainers***).
