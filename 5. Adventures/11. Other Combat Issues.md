# Other Combat Issues

## Attacking from Behind

AC bonuses from shields are negated.

## Blindness

A blind character is unable to attack.

## Bombing

Flying creatures may pick up rocks or other objects and drop them from above.

**Altitude:** At most 300’.

**Chance to hit:** 16 or higher on 1d20.

**Affected area and damage:** Depending on the size of the bomb—larger creatures can carry larger bombs. For example, a bomb from a flying creature able to carry a human might inflict 2d6 damage to all creatures hit in a 10’ × 10’ area.

## Invulnerabilities (Optional Rule)

Some monsters can only be harmed by magical or silver weapons. The referee may allow such monsters also to be harmed by attacks from:

- Another invulnerable monster.
- A monster with 5 HD or greater.

## Paralyzed Opponents

Helpless opponents, such as those magically paralyzed or frozen, can be automatically hit in melee. Only a roll for damage is required.

## Spacing

The referee should judge the number of opponents that can attack a single combatant, considering the combatant’s size and the available space around them.

**10’ passage:** Enough space for at most 2–3 characters to fight side-by-side.

## Subduing (Optional Rule)

Characters that wish to subdue an intelligent opponent may declare the intent to attack without killing.

**Blunt blows:** Only bludgeoning attacks may be made. Bladed melee weapons can deal blunt blows by attacking with the flat of the blade.

**Subdual damage:** Attack and damage rolls are handled normally, but subdual damage is noted separately from actual damage.

**Effect at 0 HP:** An intelligent character or monster reduced to 0 hit points due to subdual damage will surrender, realizing that its opponent could have killed it.

## Unarmed Attacks

**Attack rolls:** Unarmed combat is handled the same as melee combat.

**Damage:** Unarmed attacks inflict 1d2 damage, modified by STR.

## Unstable Surfaces

Characters on an unstable surface, such as a ship in rough seas or riding a flying animal, are affected as follows:

- **Missile attacks:** Suffer a -4 penalty.
- **Spells:** Cannot be cast.
- **Magic items:** Can be used normally.

Note that magical means of flight (e.g., a broom of flying, flying carpet, *fly* spell) generally do not count as unstable.

## Water

When fighting in or beneath water:

- **Penalties:** Attack and damage rolls should be penalized.
- **Missile weapons:** Usually do not work at all underwater.
