# Ability Checks

The referee may use a character’s ability scores to determine the character’s chance of succeeding at various challenging tasks.

## Rolling an Ability Check

The player rolls 1d20 and, if the result is less than or equal to the ability, the check succeeds. If the roll is greater than the ability, the check fails.

## Modifiers

Bonuses or penalties to the roll may be applied, depending on the difficulty of the task. A modifier of -4 would be a relatively easy ability check, and a +4 would be very difficult.

## 1s and 20s

A natural 1 should be treated as a success and a natural 20 treated as a failure.
