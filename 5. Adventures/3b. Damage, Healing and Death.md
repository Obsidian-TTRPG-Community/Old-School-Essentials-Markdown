# Damage, Healing, and Death

All characters and monsters have a hit point total, representing their ability to avoid death. Many attack forms, including attacks with weapons in combat, subtract hit points from this pool.

## Death

A character or monster reduced to 0 hit points or less is killed.

## Destruction of Items

If a character is killed by a destructive spell or special attack (e.g., a *lightning bolt* spell or a dragon’s breath), their equipment is assumed to be destroyed.

### Destruction of Magic Items

Magic items in the possession of a character who is killed by a destructive spell or special attack may be allowed a chance to survive, as follows:

- **Save:** For each item, a saving throw may be made using the character’s saving throw values.
- **Bonuses:** Items that grant a bonus in combat (e.g., magical weapons and armor) may also apply this bonus to the saving throw.

## Healing

**Natural:** A character or monster recovers 1d3 hit points for each full day of complete rest. The character or monster will not heal that day if the rest is interrupted.

**Magical:** Healing may also occur through magic, such as potions or spells. This kind of healing is instantaneous. Magical healing and natural healing can be combined.
