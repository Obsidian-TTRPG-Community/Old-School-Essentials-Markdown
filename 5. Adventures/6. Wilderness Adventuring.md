# Wilderness Adventuring

## Sequence of Play Per Day

1. **Decide course:** The players decide on their path of travel for the day.
2. **Losing direction:** The referee determines whether the party gets lost.
3. **Wandering monsters:** The referee makes checks as applicable.
4. **Description:** The referee describes the terrain passed through and any sites of interest the party encounters, asking players for their actions, as required. If monsters are encountered, follow the procedure described in ***Encounters***.
5. **End of day:** The referee updates time records, with special attention to rations, spell durations, and the party’s need to rest.

## Distance and Measurement

The open spaces of the wilderness mean that characters and monsters can move more freely than in a dungeon.

**Ranges and movement rates:** These are measured in yards instead of feet. This means that ranges and movement rates are tripled.

**Areas:** Spell effects, breath weapons, etc., are still measured in feet.

## Flying

**Miles per day:** The distance a creature can fly in a day is double the distance it can travel overland (see ***Overland Travel***). For example, a creature with a movement rate of 120’ could travel 24 miles overland but could fly 48 miles in a day.

**Terrain:** Does not affect air travel.

### Flying Mounts

In general, a winged beast may carry riders or other burdens based on its HD:

- **3 HD creatures:** They may carry a being about half the size of an adult human.
- **6 HD creatures:** They may carry an adult human.
- **12 HD creatures:** They may carry a large animal like a horse.
- **24 HD creatures:** They may carry a massive animal like an elephant.

## Foraging

Foraging for herbs, fruits, nuts, etc., can be performed alongside normal movement (see ***Overland Travel***). The party has a 1-in-6 chance per day of finding enough food for 1d6 human-sized beings.

## Hunting

Hunting animals takes up a complete day, with no traveling or resting possible. When hunting, there is a 1-in-6 chance of encountering animals suitable for eating (if they can be caught!). This is in addition to the normal chance of random encounters (see ***Wandering Monsters***).

## Losing Direction

At the start of each day of travel, the referee should roll to determine if the group loses direction. The probability depends on the terrain being traversed:

- **Clear, grasslands:** 1-in-6.
- **Barren lands, hills, mountains, woods:** 2-in-6.
- **Desert, jungle, swamp:** 3-in-6.

**Effects:** See ***Losing Direction***.

## Overland Travel

**Miles per day:** The number of miles a character can travel daily is ***determined by dividing their base movement rate by five***. For example, a character whose base movement rate is 120’ could travel up to 24 miles daily.

### Terrain Modifiers

Some types of terrain modify the speed at which characters can travel:

- **Broken lands, desert, forest, hills:** 33% slower.
- **Jungle, mountains, swamp:** 50% slower.
- **Maintained roads:** 50% faster.

### Forced March

If characters need to travel further in a day, they may engage in a forced march.

**Speed increase:** The distance traveled is increased by 50%. For example, a character typically traveling 24 miles daily could travel 36 miles.

**Rest:** After a forced march, characters must rest for a full day.

## Resting

**Frequency of rest:** Characters must rest for one day per six days of travel.

**Penalty for not resting:** If characters press on without resting, they suffer a penalty of -1 to hit and damage rolls until they have rested for one whole day.

## Surprise

**Surrounded:** If a party is surprised by three or more monsters, the monsters may have moved to encircle the party.

## Visibility

Characters can usually see for three miles around them in open terrain. This range may sometimes be reduced (e.g., in overgrown terrain such as a forest) or increased (e.g., looking out from the top of a mountain).

## Wandering Monsters

**Frequency:** A check is typically rolled once daily, but the referee may choose to make more checks, up to three or four per day.

**Chance:** The chance of encountering a wandering monster depends on the explored terrain (see below).

**Distance:** Wandering monsters are encountered 4d6 × 10 yards away. If either side is surprised (see ***Encounters***), this is reduced to 1d4 × 10 yards.

### Chance by Terrain

- **City, clear, grasslands, settled lands:** 1-in-6.
- **Aerial, barren, desert, forest, hills:** 2-in-6.
- **Jungle, mountains, swamp:** 3-in-6.
