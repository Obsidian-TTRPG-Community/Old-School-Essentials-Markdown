**B:** Basic characters (levels 1–3)
**X:** Expert characters (level 4+)

**Usage:** All characters (unless noted).

**Activating:** A ring’s magical effect is activated by placing it on a finger or thumb. Unless noted otherwise, a magical ring’s effect is continuously active and ends if the ring is removed.

**Multiple rings:** A character can wear two magic rings—one on each hand. If more are worn, their magical effects do not function.

**Cursed rings:** Cannot be “deactivated” by wearing more magical rings.
