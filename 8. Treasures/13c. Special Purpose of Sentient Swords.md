# Special Purpose of Sentient Swords

Some sentient swords are also imbued with a special purpose. The purpose of such swords is typically to slay a certain type of character or creature. The purpose may be rolled on the table below, or the referee may invent others.

|  d6  | Type of Target to be Slain                                   |
| :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | Arcane spell casters                                         |
|  2   | Divine spell casters                                         |
|  3   | Warriors (e.g., fighters or other primarily combat-oriented, non-spell casting classes, including non-spell casting demihumans) |
|  4   | Specific types of monsters (determined randomly)             |
|  5   | Lawful creatures (or chaotic creatures if the sword is lawful) |
|  6   | Chaotic creatures (or lawful creatures if the sword is chaotic) |

## Alignment Power

In addition to their sensory and extraordinary powers, swords of special purpose have an extra power when used to achieve their designated purpose (e.g., when attacking the enemy, the sword was designed to slay). This power depends on the swordâ€™s alignment:

- **Lawful:** Chaotic foes hit by the sword must **save versus spells** or be paralyzed.
- **Neutral:** The wielder gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws.
- **Chaotic:** Lawful foes hit by the sword must **save versus spells** or be turned to stone.
