**B:** Basic characters (levels 1–3)
**X:** Expert characters (level 4+)

**Usage:** Per normal class restrictions.

## Cursed Armor and Shields

**AC penalty:** Some types of cursed armor specify an Armor Class penalty. This modifier worsens the wearer’s Armor Class score. For example, a cursed suit of chainmail -1 grants a base Armor Class of 6 [13], one point worse than the AC 5 [14] of non-magical chainmail.

**AC 9 [10]:** Some types of cursed armor give the wearer a base Armor Class of 9 [10] (before modifiers due to Dexterity).

**Testing:** All types of tests indicate that a cursed shield or suit of armor is enchanted with a +1 bonus. It is only when the armor is used in deadly combat that the curse is revealed.

**Removing:** Once a cursed shield or suit of armor has been used, the character comes under the curse and cannot discard the item. It can only be removed with magic.

## Enchanted Armor and Shields

**AC bonus:** Enchanted armor and shields specify a protective bonus that improves the wearer’s Armor Class score. For example, a suit of chainmail +1 grants a base Armor Class of 4 [15], one point better than the AC 5 [14] of non-magical chainmail.

**Weight:** If using the optional rules for detailed encumbrance (see ***Encumbrance***), the enchanted armor’s encumbrance value is 50% less than that of normal armor.
