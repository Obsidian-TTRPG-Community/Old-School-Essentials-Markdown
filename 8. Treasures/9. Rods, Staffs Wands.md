## Charges

Rods, staves, and wands have limited uses called “charges.”

**Number of charges:** The number of charges in an item when discovered is determined by the referee and depends on the type of the item. Characters can't discover the number of charges in an item.

**Usage:** Each item used takes one round and consumes one charge.

**Consuming the last charge:** The item loses its magical potency.

**Recharging:** This is not possible.

## Rods

**Usage:** All characters (unless noted).

**Dimensions:** Thin, 3’ long.

**Charges:** Unless noted, magic rods contain 1d10 charges when found.

## Staves

**Usage:** Spell casters. Some staves may only be used by either arcane or divine spell casters (this is noted in the item’s description).

**Dimensions:** 2” thick, 6’ long.

**Charges:** Unless noted, magic staves contain 3d10 charges when found.

### Staves in Melee

Although magic-users are generally only allowed to use daggers in combat, they can use the staff of *power*, *striking*, and *wizardry* in melee.

## Wands

**Usage:** Arcane spell casters.

**Dimensions:** Thin, 1½’ long.

**Charges:** Unless noted, magic wands contain 2d10 charges when found.
