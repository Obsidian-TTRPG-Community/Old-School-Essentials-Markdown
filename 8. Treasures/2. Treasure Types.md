# Treasure Types

## Rolling Treasure

Each treasure type lists one or more types of coins or items. For each entry in the list:

1. If a percentage is given, first roll d100 to see whether this item is present.
2. If a range of values is given (e.g., 1d6 × 1,000cp, 6d6 gems), roll the specified dice to determine the quantity of this item.
3. For gems, jewelry, and magic items, the procedures for determining the value and properties of the items in the hoard are found in ***Gems and Jewellery*** and ***Magic Items***.

## Manual Adjustments

If the value of the randomly rolled treasure is significantly above or below the average value of the treasure type, the referee may adjust the results manually.

## Average Values

The average results of gems, jewelry, and all coins, excluding magic items (which have no fixed sale value).

## Coin Conversion Rates

- 1pp = 5gp
- 1gp = 2ep
- 1gp = 10sp
- 1gp = 100cp

## Hoards: A–O

These treasure types indicate the sum wealth of a large monster or a community of smaller monsters. Such hoards are usually hidden in the monsters’ lair.

**Small lairs:** Monster listings note the number of individuals found in a lair. If the number rolled is below average and the lair encounter size is at least 1d4, the hoard's treasure amount may be reduced accordingly.
