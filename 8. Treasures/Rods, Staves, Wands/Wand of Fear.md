# Wand of Fear

Conjures a cone of magical energy that terrifies those within it.

- **Area:** The cone is 60’ long and 30’ wide at the far end.
- **Creatures in the cone:** Are struck with terror and will flee from the wielder of the wand at maximum speed for 30 rounds. (A **save versus wands** negates the effect).
