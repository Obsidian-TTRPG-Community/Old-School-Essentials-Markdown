# Staff of Withering

Creatures hit by the staff are magically aged:

- **Divine magic:** Usable by divine spell casters only.
- **Effect:** The target is aged 10 years. Living creatures die upon reaching their natural life span.
- **Especially long-lived species:** Ignore the effects of a certain amount of aging. (For example, elves may ignore up to 200 years of aging, dwarves ignore up to 50 years, and so on.)
- **Undead creatures:** Are unaffected by the power of this staff.
