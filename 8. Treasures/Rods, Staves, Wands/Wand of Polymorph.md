# Wand of Polymorph

By expending a charge, the wielder of the wand or another creature within 60â€™ changes into another type of creature, as selected by the wielder. This works in the same way as the magic-user spells *polymorph self* and *polymorph others*.

- **Resisting:** An unwilling subject may make a **saving throw versus wands** to negate the effect.
