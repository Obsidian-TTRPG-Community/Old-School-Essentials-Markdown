# Rod of Cancellation

Drains the enchantment from a magic item that is touched.

- **In combat:** Usage requires an attack roll against AC 9 [10] (adjusted by the referee, if the target item is being actively used).
- **Effect:** The item that is touched becomes utterly non-magical.
- **One use only:** The rod may only be used once: it has but a single charge.
