# Wand of Lightning Bolts

Conjures strokes of powerful electricity:

- **Point of origin:** A lightning bolt may emanate from a point up to 180’ distant.
- **Area:** The bolt is 60’ long and 5’ wide.
- **Creatures caught in the lightning bolt:** Suffer 6d6 damage, with a successful **save versus wands** indicating half damage.
- **Bouncing:** If the lightning bolt hits a solid barrier before its full length is reached, it is reflected and travels for any remaining distance of its full length in the direction of the wielder of the wand.
