# Staff of Wizardry

An item of supreme wizardly power, this staff may be used as a weapon in melee, and may evoke a dozen different magical effects.

- **Arcane magic:** Usable by arcane spell casters only.
- **In melee:** Treated as a staff with a +1 magic bonus to attack and damage rolls.
- **Striking:** Expending one charge, inflicts 2d6 damage on a successful hit.
- **Cone of cold:** Conjures a cone of freezing energy, 60’ long and 30’ wide at the far end. Creatures caught in the cone suffer 8d6 damage, with a successful **save versus spells** indicating half damage.
- **Paralysation:** Conjures a cone of magical energy, 60’ long and 30’ wide at the far end. Creatures caught in the cone are paralyzed for 6 turns (**save versus spells** to avoid).
- **Spells:** Can cast: conjure elemental (8 HD), continual light, fire ball (8d6 damage), invisibility, lightning bolt (8d6 damage), pass-wall, telekinesis (up to 2,400 coins of weight), web.
- **Whirlwind:** Conjures a whirlwind 70’ tall, 20’ wide at the top, and 10’ wide at the base. The whirlwind lasts for 3 rounds and moves at 120’ (40’) as the staff's wielder directs. All in its path suffer 2d6 damage. Creatures with less than 2HD are swept aside (**save versus death** to avoid).
- **Sacrifice:** The wielder may sacrifice the staff by breaking it in two. Doing so unleashes a 30’ radius fireball that inflicts 8 points of damage per remaining charge in the staff. The wielder of the staff also suffers this damage.
