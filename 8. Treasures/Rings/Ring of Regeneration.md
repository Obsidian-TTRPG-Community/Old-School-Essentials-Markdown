# Ring of Regeneration

The wearer heals at an accelerated rate.

- **Rate:** The wearer regains 1 hit point per round.
- **Severed limbs:** Will also regrow. The rate depends on the size of the limb (e.g., a finger may regrow in one day, while a whole limb may take a week).
- **Fire or acid damage:** Cannot be regenerated.
- **Death:** The ring does not function if the wearer is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points.
