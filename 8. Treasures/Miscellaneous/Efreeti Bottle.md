# Efreeti Bottle

A 3’ tall, weighty jug with a sealed stopper. Breaking the seal and removing the stopper releases a trapped efreeti (see ***Efreeti***), who will serve the character.

- **Frequency of service:** The efreeti will serve the one who freed it (and only that character) once per day.
- **Duration:** After 101 days, its service ends. The creature then returns to its home—the legendary City of Brass.
- **If the efreeti is killed:** Its service ends.
