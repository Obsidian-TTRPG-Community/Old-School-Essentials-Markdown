# Helm of Alignment Changing

A beautifully crafted but cursed helmet.

- **Putting on the helmet:** Instantly causes the wearer’s alignment to change. The new alignment is determined at random.
- **Removing:** The curse is such that the wearer cannot remove the helmet, once in place, and will resist attempts to remove it.
- **Dispelling:** The curse can be removed by magic (e.g., *remove curse*), or (at the referee’s option) by performing a special quest.
