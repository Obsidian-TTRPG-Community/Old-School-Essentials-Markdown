# Elven Cloak and Boots

A set of enchanted boots and a matching cloak of elven origin.

- **Stealth:** The wearer of the boots can move silently.
- **Near invisibility:** The wearer of the cloak is rendered almost invisible: there is only a 1-in-6 chance of them being spotted.
- **Attacking:** The cloakâ€™s power of invisibility is nullified for one turn, if the wearer attacks.
