# Medallion of ESP 30’

A medallion on a chain, enchanted with the power of reading thoughts.

- **Focus:** By concentrating for 1 round, the wearer may target a creature within 30’.
- **Resisting:** At the referee’s option, the target may **save versus spells** to resist.
- **Concentration:** While reading thoughts, the wearer may move but cannot cast spells or attack.
- **Misfires:** The medallion is not entirely reliable. Per usage, there is a 1-in-6 chance of it misfiring, instead sending the wearer’s thoughts to all within 30’.
