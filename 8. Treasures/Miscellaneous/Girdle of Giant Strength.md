# Girdle of Giant Strength

A character who wears this girdle gains the strength of a hill giant.

- **Combat ability:** The wearerâ€™s ability in combat is augmented: the character attacks as an 8 Hit Dice monster; If the character already has better attack probabilities, the girdle does not alter these.
- **Damage:** The wearer inflicts 2d8 damage in combat, or twice normal damage, if using the optional variable weapon damage rules (see ***Combat***).
