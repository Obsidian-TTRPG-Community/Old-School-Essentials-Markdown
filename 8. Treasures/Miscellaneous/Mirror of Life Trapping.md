# Mirror of Life Trapping

A mirror with the ability to magically trap living creatures behind its pane.

- **Gazing into the mirror:** Any creature of human size or smaller who gazes into the mirror is sucked inside (**save versus spells** to resist) with all its belongings.
- **Capacity**: Up to 20 creatures can be trapped in the mirror. When this number is reached, it becomes safe to look in the mirror.
- **Inside the mirror:** A creature will live indefinitely, without the need for air or sustenance, and unaffected by aging.
- **Communication:** Trapped creatures may converse with those outside, but are utterly powerless.
- **Breaking the mirror:** Releases those trapped.
