# Helm of Reading Languages and Magic

A fragile helmet that grants the wearer the ability to read writing of all kinds.

- **Normal text:** Text in any language can be understood.
- **Magical text:** Even magical writing is comprehensible; this does not grant the ability to cast spells, however.
- **Fragility:** Each time the wearer is hit, there is a 1-in-10 chance of the helm being destroyed. If the wearer is killed, the helm is destroyed.
