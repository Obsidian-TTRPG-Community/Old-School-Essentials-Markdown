# Horn of Blasting

A horn that can be blown to release a blast of destructive noise.

- **Creatures:** Within a 100’ long cone (20’ wide at the end) suffer 2d6 damage.
- **Deafness:** Affected creatures are also deafened for one turn (**save versus spells** to avoid).
- **Buildings:** At the referee’s discretion, the horn may also be able to damage objects and buildings (e.g., a single blast might be enough to destroy a simple cottage; a 10’ section of castle wall might require three blasts).
- **Frequency:** The horn may be used once per turn.
