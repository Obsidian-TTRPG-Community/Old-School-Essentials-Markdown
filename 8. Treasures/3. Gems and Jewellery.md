# Gems and Jewellery

## Gems

The following table determines the value of each gem in a treasure hoard:

|  d20  | Gem Value |
| :---: | :-------: |
|  1–4  |   10gp    |
|  5–9  |   50gp    |
| 10–15 |   100gp   |
| 16–19 |   500gp   |
|  20   |  1,000gp  |

## Jewellery

Each piece of jewelry indicated by a treasure type is worth 3d6 × 100gp (or more, if the referee wishes, for characters above 3rd level).

### Damaged Jewellery

Rough treatment of jewelry (e.g., crushing, intense heat or fire, lightning) can damage it, reducing its value by 50%.

## Combining Values

When a treasure type indicates the presence of multiple gems or pieces of jewelry, the referee may combine the values as desired. For example, a roll of five 50gp value gems may be placed as a single 250gp gem, a 100gp gem, three 50gp gems, or any other combination.
